# Deep Learning Model

## Overview of the Analysis: ##
The purpose of this analysis is to develop a binary classifier using a deep learning model to predict whether applicants funded by Alphabet Soup will be successful. The goal is to effectively classify applicants based on provided features to optimize funding decisions.

## Results: ##

## Data Preprocessing: ##

### Target Variable(s): ###

The target variable for the model would be the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column, indicating whether an applicant was successful or not.

### Feature Variable(s): ###

The feature variables would include attributes such as "APPLICATION_TYPE," "AFFILIATION," "CLASSIFICATION," etc., which are used to predict the target variable.

### Variables to Remove: ###

Variables like "EIN" (Employer Identification Number) or "NAME_Other" may not contribute to the prediction and could be removed from the input data.

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model: ##

### Neurons, Layers, and Activation Functions: ###

Specify the number of neurons and layers in the neural network model based on the complexity of the data. Choose appropriate activation functions like ReLU or Sigmoid for each layer.

### Model Performance: ###

Evaluate the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Compare the results with the target performance metrics to assess the model's effectiveness.
### Steps to Improve Model Performance: ###

Experiment with hyperparameter tuning, adjusting the number of layers, neurons, or activation functions to enhance the model's predictive power.
